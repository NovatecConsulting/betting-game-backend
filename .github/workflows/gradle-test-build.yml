# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checks-out the repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so the job can be accessed
